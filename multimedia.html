<p>
Beyonce's music video for her famous track "Formation" has been deemed one of the most impactful music videos of all time by many, including Rolling Stone magazine. 
This music video focuses on many different social issues in the span of less than 5 minutes. 
This is not surprising as Beyonce is known for making music that is not just catchy, but also has a very important message underneath. 
When she makes a music video, she uses the different medium for the same purpose and most times will create chatter in the process. 
In this music video, she touches on racial discrimination topics that had been brought up around the time of making the video.
She also sheds light to many of the issues women face. 
Most importantly, she combines both of these to bring to light what it's like to be a black women and that she is proud of the natural beauty that accompanies who she is.
The music video has created a big stir because of the huge social inequities and issues it's bringing up all in one.
Many artists would have trouble properly conveying a message about one or the other in a way that resonates with audiences.
Beyonce rises to the challenge and does so with the flare that we would expect of her. Well done Queen Bey!
